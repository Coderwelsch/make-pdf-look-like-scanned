# Make PDF Look Like Scanned

![Preview](docs/recording.gif)

A little macOS automator script that generates (multipaged) pdfs looked like scanned. This script is just a little enhancement of to the awesome work of [Pezmc’s Gist](https://gist.github.com/Pezmc/38017cb03daccb17d3835280c568dc0f). I’ve just added a little «scan» shadow to the pdf pages.
